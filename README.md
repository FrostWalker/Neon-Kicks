The Neon Kicks arenÂ’t just any old pair of shoes, they are a wearable technology that reacts to the way you move and dance. Light up the dance floor in over 16 million colours, these shoes will make you the centre of attention at any party! These shoes are targeted towards young people, primarily university students, who like to party and go to clubs. The Neon Kicks contain a multi-colour RGB LED strip along the outsole of the shoe, which light up in reaction to the way you move your feet. Different moves and dances will produce different colour patterns.
